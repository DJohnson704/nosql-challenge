# NoSQL Project - Setup and Analysis

This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks designed to guide you through the setup and analysis of a NoSQL database, focusing on MongoDB. Below is a brief overview of each notebook and instructions on how to use them.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`

#### Purpose:
This notebook is intended to help you set up a MongoDB database and load data into it. It covers the basic steps required to establish a connection to a MongoDB instance, create a database, and insert data. This setup is crucial for performing further analysis in subsequent notebooks.

#### Contents:
- **MongoDB Connection**: Instructions and code to connect to a MongoDB instance using Python's `pymongo` library.
- **Database and Collection Creation**: Steps to create a new database and collection within MongoDB.
- **Data Insertion**: Examples of how to insert documents into the MongoDB collection.
- **Verification**: Commands to verify that the data has been successfully inserted.

### 2. `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb`

#### Purpose:
This notebook focuses on performing analysis on the data stored in the MongoDB database. It includes examples of querying the database, aggregating data, and processing results for insights.

#### Contents:
- **Basic Queries**: Examples of how to query the database for specific documents or collections of documents based on various criteria.
- **Aggregation Pipeline**: Instructions on how to use MongoDB's aggregation framework to group, filter, and sort data.
- **Advanced Analysis**: Techniques for more complex data analysis, including matching, grouping, and sorting operations on the dataset.
- **Result Interpretation**: Guidance on how to interpret the results of the analysis and potential use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **MongoDB**: Ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine or accessible via a remote server.
- **Python 3.x**: The notebooks are written in Python, so you'll need a Python environment set up with the necessary packages.
- **Required Packages**: You can install the required Python packages using the following command:
  
  ```bash
  pip install pymongo
